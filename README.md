# INF-beta-Temperature
Visualization of a patient temperature increase after taking Interferon beta injection.

Avonex is a Multiple Sclerosis drug, administered weekly through an intramuscular injection. It can cause various side effects, the most common of which are flu-like symptoms like body temperature increase and muscle aches.

I have gathered (and continue to gather) data of the body temperature of the patient at various time points after the intake of the drug.
The goal of this project is to visualize graphically the change of the body temperature over time.

Data is contained in csv files. 
Graphics are made with ggplot2 library in R environment.
